Project Goal:<br>
Our objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts an individual’s risk of developing diabetes by leveraging both clustering and classification techniques.<br> Classification Approach:<br>
We aim to train the model to distinguish between individuals at risk of developing diabetes and those who are not, utilizing a comprehensive set of health-related attributes.<br>
Clustering Approach:<br>
Our model will analyze underlying patterns within the data to identify distinct groups of individuals with similar risk profiles. These clusters will then be used to predict outcomes for new individuals, enhancing the model’s predictive accuracy and providing deeper insights into diabetes risk factors. <br>
